## Introduction

* Why computer vision?
* More Pixels Law
* Capture, Filter, Calibrate, Track, Shape, Train, Combine
* Follow in the Footsteps of Giants
* What you should know about Processing

## World of Filters

* Threshold
* Adaptive Threshold
* Blur
* Dilate and Erode
* Histogram Equalization
* Edge detection
* Brightness/contrast
* Region of Interest

## Calibrate

* Barrel and perspective distortion correction
* Calibrating a camera with grids

## Track All The Things

* Deciding which detector to use
* Color Tracking in HSV Color Space
* Brightness Tracking
* Feature Tracking
* Background Subtraction
* Running average of background
* Motion Detection
* Temporal Coherence for Blobs
* Windowed search
* Skin detection 
* Face detection

## The Shape of Things

* Find Vertical and Horizontal Lines with Sobel Edge Detection and Polygon Approximation
* Sobel vs. Hough
* Point of Maximum Curvature
* Convexity Defects
* Top Pixel
* Contour Winding Holes
* Contour smoothing

## Training Program

* Histograms for SVM (color, contour)
* Histogram of Oriented Gradients for SVM
* K-Nearest Neighbor
* Neural Networks in OpenCV

## Projects

* Kinograph
* Overhead Robot Tracking
* Food Cart Calendar
* Text Rain
* AR Marker Tracking
