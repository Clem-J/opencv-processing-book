# Getting Started with Computer Vision

This book aspires to provide an easy entry point for creative experimentation with computer vision. It introduces the code and concepts necessary to build computer vision projects with the [Processing](http://processing.org) creative coding environment and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org), the definitive open source computer vision library. It is designed to be accessible to a beginner audience, but also to instill the fundamental concepts of the field, enabling readers to not just follow recipes, but build their own projects.

This book is being developed in parallel with [OpenCV for Processing](http://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing), a Processing library that provides access to OpenCV. All of its code examples use that OpenCV for Processing and it acts as the definitive documentation for that library.

_Getting Started with Computer Vision_ is an in-progress community project begun in May of 2013. It is generously supported by [O'Reilly Media](http://oreill.com) and will be published for public consumption by them. It's text is available freely here under a Creative Commons license.

It is currently highly incomplete but under rapid development. Suggestions, contributions, corrections, and pull requests are highly welcome.
